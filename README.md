Imagine if feedbacks in hotels/restaurants were taken on Alexa... Just to have a look developed one. Check out the details below.

<b><h4> Step 1: Setup Alexa </b><h4>
  <ul><li><h5>Define intents - Here we have defined 2 of them</h5> </li>
  <ol><li> Start Intent - Executes when the alexa feedback app opens and asks user for bill no.</li>
    <li>Answer Intent - Ask Questions and accepts answers with rating of 1 to 5, yes/no, good/avg/bad and imporvemnt category depending on the question</li>
    <li>Built in Intents - Cancel, Restart Intents</li></ol>
</ul>
